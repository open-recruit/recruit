/// One detected "a patient was newly recommended" fact, written once by NotificationDetectorService
/// and never mutated. Keyed by the trial's business identifier ("system|value", see
/// TrialIdentifier), not the FHIR List's logical id - that's server-local and can change (e.g. if a
/// study's screening list is ever recreated), so it's resolved fresh via
/// TrialListResolver.ResolveListForTrialAsync whenever a link is actually needed (sender,
/// feed), rather than cached here. PatientDisplayName is still denormalized (a snapshot, same as
/// ScreeningNote.AuthorDisplayName) since it has no such correctness requirement and re-resolving
/// it would cost a FHIR read per event for no benefit. DedupeKey
/// ("{trialIdentifier}:{listVersionId}:{patientReference}") makes the insert idempotent if the
/// detector's poll tick overlaps across replicas.
